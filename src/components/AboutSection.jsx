      <h6>Who I Am</h6>

      <p className="text-accent-foreground mt-2">
        I'm a QA Automation Engineer with some Frontend experience (React.js,
        JavaScript, TypeScript). I work well with remote teams from different
        countries. I create reliable tests—from full end-to-end tests to small
        unit tests—and help make sure websites and apps work well, including on
        mobile using BrowserStack.
      </p>

      <p className="text-accent-foreground mt-2">
        I enjoy working in Agile teams and use tools like Jira, Trello, Azure
        DevOps, and ClickUp to stay organized. I work with Playwright, Cypress,
        Selenium, and Jest to write automated tests, and I also set up GitHub
        Actions to run tests and deploy code. Whether it’s manual or automated
        testing, I care about doing things the right way and making sure
        everything works smoothly.
