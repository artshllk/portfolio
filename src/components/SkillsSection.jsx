      <h6>What I Do</h6>

      <p className="text-accent-foreground mt-2">
        <strong>JavaScript:</strong> I write clean and easy-to-understand code
        with JavaScript. I've built interactive websites and know how to work
        with logic and async stuff like API calls.
      </p>

      <p className="text-accent-foreground mt-2">
        <strong>Cypress:</strong> I use Cypress to test how websites work from
        start to finish. I've helped move tests over to Cypress and made them
        faster and more stable.
      </p>

      <p className="text-accent-foreground mt-2">
        <strong>Playwright:</strong> I test websites automatically using
        Playwright. I've made tests faster and helped make sure they work well
        in CI/CD pipelines.
      </p>

      <p className="text-accent-foreground mt-2">
        <strong>React.js:</strong> I build responsive and easy-to-use user
        interfaces with React. I'm comfortable with hooks, state, and breaking
        things into components.
      </p>

      <p className="text-accent-foreground mt-2">
        <strong>TypeScript:</strong> I use TypeScript to catch bugs early and
        keep code organized. I understand how to use types and interfaces to
        make code safer.
      </p>

      <p className="text-accent-foreground mt-2">
        <strong>GitHub Actions:</strong> I set up automated workflows with
        GitHub Actions to help with testing and deployments. I've created
        reusable setups that save time for the team.
      </p>

      <p className="text-accent-foreground mt-2">
        <strong>Postman:</strong> I use Postman to test APIs manually. It's
        helpful when checking responses and making sure endpoints are working
        like they should.
      </p>

      <p className="text-accent-foreground mt-2">
        <strong>BrowserStack:</strong> I test websites on different browsers and
        devices using BrowserStack, so everything works smoothly for everyone.
      </p>

      <p className="text-accent-foreground mt-2">
        <strong>Tracking Tools:</strong> Iâ€™ve worked with Jira, Trello, Azure
        DevOps, and ClickUp to track tasks, bugs, and progress. It helps keep
        things organized and clear.
      </p>

      <p className="text-accent-foreground mt-2">
        <strong>Selenium:</strong> Recently, I worked on a personal project
        using Selenium for browser automation. It's been a great tool to get
        hands-on experience with web testing.
      </p>

      <p className="text-accent-foreground mt-2">
        <strong>Mobile QA:</strong> I perform mobile testing on both websites
        and apps across multiple devices. This allows me to ensure that
        everything works well on various screen sizes and mobile environments.
      </p>
